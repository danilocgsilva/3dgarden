# Publishing 3d into web

This is an typical node project. If you already is used to such project, you know:

```
npm install
npm run dev-default
```

After the npm install, other scripts other than `dev-default` are available as well:

```
npm run dev-2000
```
Will display 2.000 cubes randonly positioned in space forming a sphere.

```
npm run dev-10000
```
Will display 10.000 cubes randonly positioned in space forming a sphere.

This set is based on Three.js starterkit from Bruno Simon of https://threejs-journey.xyz/.

Having the things running in web is a more suitable way to publish an show things to people.

## How to play with it?

After running the project, you can spect the resulting through 3d space:

* click and drag: rotate the forming sphere
* scroll well, or drag the middle mouse button: zoom in and zoom out
* shift + click and drag: perform a *pan* move
