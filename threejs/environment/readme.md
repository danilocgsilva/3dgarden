# Publishing 3d into web

This is an typical node project. If you already is used to such project, you know:

```
npm install
npm run dev-10000
```

This set is based on Three.js starterkit from Bruno Simon of https://threejs-journey.xyz/

Having the things running in web is a more suitable way to publish an show things to people.
